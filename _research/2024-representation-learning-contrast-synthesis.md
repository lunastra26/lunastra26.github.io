title: "Representation Learning approaches for MRI contrast synthesis"
collection: research
---

<ul>
<li> Leverage shared information in multi-contrast MR images to synthesize Gd-enhanced contrast MR images from non-contrast enhanced MR images that are routinely acquired in the clinic.</li>
<li> Synthesize white matter nulled MPRAGE images from conventional T1-weighted MPRAGE images to improve thalamic nuclei segmentation.</li>
</ul>
