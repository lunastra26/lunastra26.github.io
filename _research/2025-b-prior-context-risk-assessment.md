<ul>
  <li> Develop AI-based longitudinal and multi-modal risk refinement approaches, modeled on human physicians, that can accomodate variable and limited prior context into risk assessment frameworks. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15591" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </li>
  <li> Develop foundation models to learn generalized representations from multi-modal (imaging + clinical variables) medical data </li>
