Leverage underlying tissue-specific information in multi-contrast MR images to learn representations of local regions in an image such that regions belonging to similar tissue types generate similar representations. This constained contrastive learning approach is used to pretrain deep learning models to reduce the amount of labeled data required for downstream segmentation tasks in MRI.
