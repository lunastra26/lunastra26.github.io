Objectives: 
Despite its high negative predictive value (NPV) for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), MRI suffers from a substantial number of false positives, especially for intermediate-risk cases. In this work, we determine whether a deep learning model trained with PI-RADS–guided representation learning can disambiguate the PI-RADS 3 classification, detect csPCa from bi-parametric prostate MR images, and avoid unnecessary benign biopsies.


Conclusions: 
Our PI-RADS–guided deep learning RL model learns summary representations from bi-parametric prostate MR images that can provide additional information to disambiguate intermediate-risk PI-RADS 3 assessments. The resulting RL-based biopsy decision models also outperformed radiologists in avoiding benign biopsies while maintaining comparable sensitivity to csPCa for the all-PI-RADS cohort. Such AI models can easily be integrated into clinical practice to supplement radiologists’ reads in general and improve biopsy yield for any equivocal decisions.
